problem sighted
problem identified
research done

wait for the "guilty" one while doing more research or just explaining the problem to others or whatever seems reasonable during this hard times - except fixing the damn problem

having the solution basically figured out or not, but discussed it all morning instead of reverting a commit or working around it locally

this is _not_ what swarming is supposed to mean....
