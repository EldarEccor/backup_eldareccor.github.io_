Every once in a while I have to fix a legacy build which always means one thing: Welcome back to [ant](http://ant.apache.org). As I tend to struggle with how ant handles paths, files, filesets, mappers and properties, I decided to share our example :)

After moving a *lib* directory that servers as our ivy dump all of a sudden the build failed because the packaged artifact did not include all *.jar files. As the compiler did not complain at all I zeroed in on the packaging and found this gem:

```xml
<target name="collect.io.common.libs">	
	...	
	...	
	<!-- Replace ant project names from ${basedir} and gain the root directory -->
	<pathconvert property="app.root.dir">
		<path>
			<path location="${basedir}" />
		</path>
		<filtermapper>
			<replacestring from="${ant.project.name}" to="" />
		</filtermapper>
	</pathconvert>
	<!-- Set the lib.dir in relativ position to app.root.dir -->
	<pathconvert property="root.dir" setonempty="false">
		<path>
			<path location="${lib.dir}" />
		</path>
		<globmapper from="${root.dir}*" to="*" casesensitive="false" />
	</pathconvert>
	<fail unless="lib.root.dir" message="The 'lib.dir' property in build.properties should denote to a path at ${root.dir}" />
	<!-- Create the file name only includes list -->
	<pathconvert property="includes.relative" pathsep="," refid="runtime.client.classpath">
		<globmapper from="${root.dir}*" to="*" casesensitive="no" />
	</pathconvert>
	<fileset id="runtime.client.includes" dir="${root.dir}" includes="${includes.relative}" />
	<!-- Copy all libs to the temporary folder structure -->
	<copy todir="${build.batchclient.dir}/common/lib">
		<flattenmapper />
		...
		<fileset refid="runtime.client.includes">
		...
		</fileset>
	</copy>
</target>
```

What this code does (and has done correctly for years) is map all files in the existing path 'runtime.client.classpath' as relative to the apps root directory, comma-separate them and create a fileset based the created list. All files in the fileset will then be copied to a temp directory for packaging.  Unfortunately ant cannot use a path to "collect" files, so this conversion is mandatory. So far so good, but now we have the constraint that everything has to be located in one (root) directory. 

Due to project needs this is no longer viable. Not all libs will be included in the projects root dir anymore for some build environments. After re-reading some ant doc and try-and-error we decided to:

 - Split up the existing path (using fully qualified names as paths tend to do) in 2 expressions that will create 2 filesets (one including the libs that moved and one including the rest).
 - Prepare comma-separated include expressions flexible enough to be used for the fileset creation
 	- Use regular expression to create entries like \*\*/junit.jar* in order to ignore subdirectories.
 	- Due to Windows wonderful use of "\" in ant's ${basedir}: Escape the unwanted regexp literals ;)
 - Keep using a flatten mapper to copy only the files (not their directories) to the destination
 
Customized for our lib structure which only allows one level of depth (i.e. libs/*/*.jar) the result looks like the following.

```xml
<!-- Create the file name only includes lists -->
<pathconvert property="includes.app.relative" pathsep="," refid="runtime.client.classpath">
	<globmapper from="${app.root.dir}*" to="*" casesensitive="no" />				
</pathconvert>
<!-- 
	Windows based ${basedir} contains backslahes, which makes problems when using it in a regexp.
	We might need to do this for basedir before resolving the other dirs in app_common?! 
-->
<propertyregex property="escaped.lib.dir" input="${lib.dir}" regexp="\\" replace="/" global="true" defaultValue="${lib.dir}" />
<!-- convert to format **/hello.jar to be used in the fileset matcher later -->
<pathconvert property="includes.libs.relative" pathsep="," refid="runtime.client.classpath">
	<mapper type="regexp" from="${lib.dir}/(.*)/(.*).jar" to="**/\2.jar" />				
</pathconvert>
<!-- only resolves correctly for app libs -->
<fileset id="runtime.app.includes" dir="${app.root.dir}" includes="${includes.app.relative}" />
<!-- only resolves correctly for external libs -->
<fileset id="runtime.client.includes" dir="${lib.dir}" includes="${includes.libs.relative}" />
<copy todir="${build.batchclient.dir}/common/lib">
	<flattenmapper />
	...
	<fileset refid="runtime.app.includes" />
	<fileset refid="runtime.client.includes" />			
</copy>
```

This is probably not a beautiful solution, but seems to be working for now... You can say a lot about ant, but it usually gets the job done (somehow) ;-)
