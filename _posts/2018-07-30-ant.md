title: Legacy ANT paths, properties, filesets and more

Every once in a while I have to fix a legacy build which always means one thing: Welcome back to [ant](http://ant.apache.org). As I tend to struggle with how ant handles paths, files, filesets, mappers and properties, I decided to share our example :)

After moving a *lib* directory that servers as our ivy dump all of a sudden the build failed because the packaged artifact did not include all *.jar files. As the compiler did not complain at all I zeroed in on the packaging and found this gem:

```xml
<target name="collect.io.common.libs">	
	...
	<!-- Replace ant project names from ${basedir} and gain the root directory -->
	<pathconvert property="kams.root.dir">
		<path>
			<path location="${basedir}" />
		</path>
		<filtermapper>
			<replacestring from="${ant.project.name}" to="" />
		</filtermapper>
	</pathconvert>
	<!-- Set the lib.dir in relativ position to kams.root.dir -->
	<pathconvert property="root.dir" setonempty="false">
		<path>
			<path location="${lib.dir}" />
		</path>
		<globmapper from="${root.dir}*" to="*" casesensitive="false" />
	</pathconvert>
	<fail unless="lib.root.dir" message="The 'lib.dir' property in build.properties should denote to a path at ${root.dir}" />
	<!-- Create the file name only includes list -->
	<pathconvert property="includes.relative" pathsep="," refid="runtime.client.classpath">
		<globmapper from="${root.dir}*" to="*" casesensitive="no" />
	</pathconvert>
	<fileset id="runtime.client.includes" dir="${root.dir}" includes="${includes.relative}" />
	<!-- Copy all libs to the temporary folder structure -->
	<copy todir="${build.batchclient.dir}/common/lib">
		<flattenmapper />
		...
		<fileset refid="runtime.client.includes" />
	</copy>
</target>
```

What this code does (and has done correctly for years) is map all files in the existing path 'runtime.client.classpath' as relative to this directory, comma-separate them and create a fileset for the root dir including all libs which will be copied to a temp directory for packaging. So far so good, but now we have the constraint that everything has to be located in one (root) directory. 

Due to project needs this is no longer viable. Not all libs will be included in the projects root dir anymore for some build environments. After re-reading some ant doc, i came up with the following solution:

 - Split up the existing path (using fully qualified names as paths tend to do) in 2 expressions that will create 2 filesets (one including the libs that moved and one including the rest).
 - Prepare comma-separated include expressions flexible enough to be used for the fileset creation
 	- Use regular expression to create entries like \*\*/junit.jar* in order to ignore subdirectories. 
 - Keep using a flatten mapper to copy only the files (not their directories) to the destination
 
Customized for our lib structure which only allows one level of depth (i.e. libs/*/*.jar) the result looks like the following.

```xml
<!-- Create the file name only includes lists -->
<pathconvert property="includes.kams.relative" pathsep="," refid="runtime.client.classpath">
	<globmapper from="${kams.root.dir}*" to="*" casesensitive="no" />				
</pathconvert>
<!-- convert to format **/hello.jar in order to be used in the fileset matcher later -->
<pathconvert property="includes.libs.relative" pathsep="," refid="runtime.client.classpath">
<mapper type="regexp" from="${lib.dir}/(.*)/(.*).jar" to="**/\2.jar" />				
</pathconvert>
<!-- only resolves correctly for KAMS libs -->
<fileset id="runtime.kams.includes" dir="${kams.root.dir}" includes="${includes.kams.relative}" />
<!-- only resolves correctly for external libs -->
<fileset id="runtime.client.includes" dir="${lib.dir}" includes="${includes.libs.relative}" />
<copy todir="${build.batchclient.dir}/common/lib">
	<flattenmapper />
	...
	<fileset refid="runtime.kams.includes" />
	<fileset refid="runtime.client.includes" />			
</copy>
```
